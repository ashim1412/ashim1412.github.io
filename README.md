# 👋 Hi, I’m Ashim Shrestha

I’m a **Senior Data Analyst / Analytics Engineer (Product Analytics–leaning)** with experience building reliable analytics foundations and translating data into product and business decisions.

I focus on **how data is produced, modelled, and consumed**, not just on reporting outputs. My work emphasises **trustworthy metrics, scalable data models, and insight-driven decision-making**.

## 💼 Experience & Impact

### 📊 Data Analyst

I work across **high-volume, complex datasets**, supporting decision-making through rigorous analysis, experimentation, and clear communication. My experience spans **customer behaviour analysis, product performance, and research-driven insights**, with a strong focus on data quality and hypothesis-led work.

**What I do in practice:**
- Analyse large-scale **transactional and behavioural datasets** to uncover patterns, risks, and opportunities  
- Build **probability and predictive models** to support demand estimation and product decision-making  
- Perform **exploratory analysis, hypothesis testing, and validation** to answer ambiguous business questions  
- Define, standardise, and maintain **core metrics & KPIs** used across teams  
- Translate open-ended problems into **structured analytical frameworks**  
- Deliver insights via **dashboards, concise summaries, and actionable recommendations**  
- Partner closely with stakeholders to support **research-driven and data-informed decisions**

My focus is on **explainable analysis**, not black-box outputs.

## 🏗️ Analytics Engineering Mindset

I approach analytics as a **system**, not a one-off analysis.

- Model data for **reusability and consistency**
- Prefer **clean transformations** over complex dashboards
- Design datasets that support **self-serve analytics**
- Optimize for **long-term maintainability**, not quick wins

I care deeply about **metric correctness**, **data lineage**, and **semantic clarity**.

## 📈 Product Analytics Perspective

From a product lens, I focus on:
- User behaviour & lifecycle analysis
- Funnel performance and drop-off points
- Feature adoption and engagement signals
- Translating usage data into **product hypotheses**

I aim to help teams answer:
> *What should we build, improve, or stop - and why?*
